                    Web development isn’t without facing problems.
Even to a noob of the web and coding world having only touched the tip of the iceberg, solving problems is a regular routine, but it’s the reason why Web development exists. From the day 1 coder to the industry veteran, web development exists because we have the goal of finding solutions for the webs problems.

                    As part of my learning its crucial that I’m often exposed to problems on a regular basis; not just for the sake of knowledge, experience and learning, but to develop and strengthen the essential problem-solving skills needed.

                    At one stage early on through my learning at Dev Academy I got stuck on the task of creating CSS for the design of my blog page. I had multiple pages developed looking just the way I wanted them to be, but with a new blog post containing new content that of course needed its own unique class or ID. With the new CSS rules created, and the desire to develop my nav bar for something better, all my pages were out whack. I couldn’t figure out what was wrong. It took plenty of time to diagnose the problem, and then more on top to go back and fix everything on the previous pages.

                    I was running short of time, and the stress was getting a bit much. Sitting there feeling defeated and frustrated I knew I had to take a step back. Later that night while spending time with my partner and approached the problem again with a clear mind. It weas quite interesting what happened next. I sat there speaking out loud the problems I had to face. Next, I spoke out loud the steps I had to take to solve the problem, and then I even continued to speak out loud as I followed though solving the task. It wasn’t until just recently that I realised I was using the “rubber-ducky method”. I was speaking out loud to my partner, talking her through the problems I was facing as if I was guiding myself through them. I found this problem-solving technique extremely helpful.
something about taking the jumble of words and thoughts that are zooming around your brain and putting it out loud into words for yourself to see more clearly. It’s a technique I am now very fond of practising.

                    As the sprints have carried on, the problems change and evolve but the skills and techniques never really change. I now face a lot of JavaScript, a language that is well known to be hard to understand and unforgiving at times. It was here where my problem-solving skills were really put to the test; I had to reach out quite often to both my peers and facilitators, write pseudocode and console.log like crazy, and the hours I put into googling!

                    Thankfully after some time I was able to solve the problems and complete the tasks at hand, but it didn’t end there. As I went through the process, I learnt a lot more than I expected. I now had a list of things I didn’t know that I could research, and I now had skills and techniques in problem-solving!
