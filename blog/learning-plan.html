                    My long-term goal is to get a career as a full stack web developer. I am primarily intending to get full time permanent employment for a company but am also attracted to contracting. I prefer permanent employment for a company and its service as I think I would far more enjoy the satisfaction and reward of dedicating myself fully to one project, seeing it grow, evolve, and progress over time. I am also attracted to the thought of contracting as it gives the potential for taking part in many websites and projects; being constantly stimulated by many different contracts and their creative outcomes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Considering all my strengths and limitations doesn’t make the decision between permanent employment and contracting easy. On the one hand some of my traits would prove that permanent would be a good choice as I am loyal, curious, and even sometimes “nit-picky” on specific aspects. The thought of working on one thing making it as perfect as possible would be extremely rewarding and satisfying, similar maybe to a parent watching their child grow. On the other hand, other traits of mine would pull me towards contracting. Sometimes I can suffer from impatience and getting bored easily; The need for new and constant stimulation worries me as maybe I will get bored if I work permanently for one company, and that contracting can keep me stimulated.

                    In my time at EDA, I want to work on improving my skill set and traits as well as developing new ones that I know are crucial in my own learning as well as in an employment context. I Feel my experience in Hospitality in a management position means I can do well under stress, work well with others, and have good social skills but a big hurdle I often come up against is the feeling of being overwhelmed and anxious. This often affects my motivation in any task. Of course, this kind of hurdle can be a huge detriment to my productivity and success. I have been able to identify that these feelings often stem from the idea that my knowledge and skill in the tech side of these challenges is inadequate.
This kind of limitation, and the thought of how I can overcome it is always on my mind. Taking the content provided in the pre-curriculum and putting it into practice, reaching out to facilitators, friends, family, and fellow cohort members in my times of need are something I need to push myself to do.

                    I only have one major commitment outside of my life at EDA at the moment at that is spending time with my girlfriend. We spend weekends together as well as Wednesday nights, that way we don’t have to go through a full work week without seeing each other.
I intend to commit to a boxing gym on Vivian Street called “the lion pit” as I used to box. I Think that staying active and looking after my physical health will have a profound affect on my mental health and well-being. I plan to attend classes 2-3 times a week, either at 5.30 or 6.30, and take advantage of the 24-hour availability whenever I can.

                <p>
                    My career path goals have become far more defined over the course of foundations. My goal is to become a front-end web-developer. I’d love to work with UI and UX, but I’m keen to learn more of what’s out there to be involved in. I think UI and UX is a good option for me as I’m creative and visually stimulated, the way things look and how things work on a page is something I have a great passion for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’d prefer to start my career in a permanent position for a company to help build a foundation for myself, learning and forming connections, and when the time is right consider working as a contractor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think my greatest strengths come from my EQ rather than IQ. I have good people skills, good empathy, and can cooperate well with others. My greatest limitations on the other hand are my technical skills in web-development. While it’s been awesome to observe how much I’ve learnt and how much I’ve grown I am still aware that my technical skills set is still only at beginner level. Because of this I do sometimes fear that when working in team settings I’ll only inhibit progress. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges I’ll have to face is how I look after myself. Making sure that I give myself breaks, don’t put too much pressure on myself, don’t isolate myself, and staying focused when I feel overwhelmed. I’ve often been scared or hesitant to ask for help in the past. I’ve learnt that this has come from a subconscious idea that because I don’t know something, something must be wrong with me. What is most strange is that I’ve never had these thoughts towards others. I’m always enthusiastic to help and support others. Over the course of foundations, I’ve been able to identify these challenges and have learnt many methods to help so I’m not too concerned.

                    During bootcamp the kind of support that will benefit me the most will be guidance when I feel lost, and feedback as I progress. There have been times during foundations where I had spent a lot of time searching for resources or answers and I was getting nowhere, overwhelmed by unrelated information and unable to find the answers. In times like these I may need to rely on learning from my peers or facilitators.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for expectations for myself during bootcamp, I know that this is an extremely intense period of learning that includes a lot of team effort. Because of this I want to create as much free time as possible. I want to keep my schedule as free as possible to be able to commit to the upcoming workload. As I am yet to enter the bootcamp my expectations may not be accurate, and so this can be developed over time.
