                    My long-term goal is to get a career as a full stack web developer. I am primarily intending to get full time permanent employment for a company but am also attracted to contracting. I prefer permanent employment for a company and its service as I think I would far more enjoy the satisfaction and reward of dedicating myself fully to one project, seeing it grow, evolve, and progress over time. I am also attracted to the thought of contracting as it gives the potential for taking part in many websites and projects; being constantly stimulated by many different contracts and their creative outcomes.

                    Considering all my strengths and limitations doesn’t make the decision between permanent employment and contracting easy. On the one hand some of my traits would prove that permanent would be a good choice as I am loyal, curious, and even sometimes “nit-picky” on specific aspects. The thought of working on one thing making it as perfect as possible would be extremely rewarding and satisfying, similar maybe to a parent watching their child grow. On the other hand, other traits of mine would pull me towards contracting. Sometimes I can suffer from impatience and getting bored easily; The need for new and constant stimulation worries me as maybe I will get bored if I work permanently for one company, and that contracting can keep me stimulated.

                    In my time at EDA, I want to work on improving my skill set and traits as well as developing new ones that I know are crucial in my own learning as well as in an employment context. I Feel my experience in Hospitality in a management position means I can do well under stress, work well with others, and have good social skills but a big hurdle I often come up against is the feeling of being overwhelmed and anxious. This often affects my motivation in any task. Of course, this kind of hurdle can be a huge detriment to my productivity and success. I have been able to identify that these feelings often stem from the idea that my knowledge and skill in the tech side of these challenges is inadequate.
This kind of limitation, and the thought of how I can overcome it is always on my mind. Taking the content provided in the pre-curriculum and putting it into practice, reaching out to facilitators, friends, family, and fellow cohort members in my times of need are something I need to push myself to do.

                    I only have one major commitment outside of my life at EDA at the moment at that is spending time with my girlfriend. We spend weekends together as well as Wednesday nights, that way we don’t have to go through a full work week without seeing each other.
I intend to commit to a boxing gym on Vivian Street called “the lion pit” as I used to box. I Think that staying active and looking after my physical health will have a profound affect on my mental health and well-being. I plan to attend classes 2-3 times a week, either at 5.30 or 6.30, and take advantage of the 24-hour availability whenever I can.
