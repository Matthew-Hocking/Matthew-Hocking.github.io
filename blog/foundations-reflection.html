                    <li>
                        <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I feared admitting ignorance, the thought of being judged or deemed as stupid was terrifying and paralyzing. It really inhibited my learning at times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had a fixed mindset.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I put an incredibly unhealthy amount of pressure on myself.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h2>What are the roles of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These things are incredibly important but not mutually exclusive to learning or programming.
Having values is about creating your own compass in which you direct yourself through life. Empathy is crucial when working or interacting with others because if you are going to be part of a team then you need to understand your team. What drives them, how to communicate, how are they feeling etc. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    Being self-aware is important as it helps us have a better understanding of ourselves and our actions, and how those actions can affect others.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Everything within the core exercises came naturally to me if I didn’t already know about them.
I’m already quite self-aware, and have a strong EQ. When I was exploring my own identity early on in foundations, I took the 16 personalities test. I typically don’t back or believe in such things like this, but I put in the effort for the test and was extremely surprised by the result. It labelled me as a “mediator” (INFP) and I felt like it was spot on. I’ve never identified myself with anything more than that.

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The only thing that was new and the most important for me to learn was learning about neuroplasticity and a growth mindset. I have suffered from having a fixed mindset thinking that my strengths and abilities were never going to change, and that if it was something I wasn’t naturally gifted at then I would never get better. Learning how to look after and support myself was the biggest challenge.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I think because as part of teaching us how to become great web-developers, and how important our success and employment in the industry is to the dev academy, a great deal of it all relies on what kind of people we are. The core learnings help us grow as people and build a more adaptive and understanding mind for us to learn, express and co-operate.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    No, not at all. As someone who is brand new to learning web-development and the world of code etc, a great deal of the core learnings was crucial. Of course, learning web-development was important but learning how to learn, how to treat and look after my own body and mind were arguably more important. Sure, I could have spent time learning web-development on my own, but it’s because of the core teachings that I was able to increase my potential and learn more, as well as learning how to look after myself.
