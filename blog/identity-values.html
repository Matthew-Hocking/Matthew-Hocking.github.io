                <p>
                    I often think of my own core values, principles, and virtues; it’s something that I constantly critique myself against and hold myself to. But the thought of turning those feelings and ideas into written word is an exceedingly difficult one. It sounds like quite a paradox to have such a strong code that guides you through life, but once you try to translate it onto paper it feels wrong or uncomfortable. But that grants insight into how my brain works, and I’m sure there’s many others who feel the same way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many values that I find important to guide me through life, and the list may seem extensive; Empathy, honesty, loyalty, responsibility, perspective, open-mindedness, and fairness are a few of the major ones. But because I have such a strong code, I am also quite self-critical, stubborn, and have trouble getting along with people who contrast my own values.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These values were some that were constantly put to use as a manager in hospitality. Often being in situations that required an ethical decision quickly on the spot, and often with a lot of pressure and confrontation. Many times, I would have to remedy situations where a patron was in breach of our license. If a customer were to take their drink off the premises to either grab a smoke or some fresh air, that is obviously in breach of our license which is unacceptable. But of course, how I read and treat the situation can have make a very big difference in the outcome. Has the customer been kind and polite? Yes? Then just a kind and polite word that it’s against the rules is obviously the best choice, the problem is remedied, and you’ll still have a happy customer who is happy to come back again. Is the customer aggressive or dangerous? Yes? Then maybe the best solution is to be firm and unwavering, so they have no choice but to either come inside and follow the rules or leave. Now you may lose a future customer, but you have stayed true to your duty. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My strengths like enthusiasm, passion, patience, and drive will help me in my learning journey. I’ll often hit obstacles, and have already hit a few, that require these kinds of strengths to be able to push through. Especially when in team or group situations coming up, they’ll be even more crucial in our joint success. Resistance when working with others is often an obstacle, but there’s always ways to prevent or resolve the issue. 
There have been many instances of resistance when working with colleagues in my time in hospitality; but communication, reasoning, perspective, and understanding the shared common goal are some good strategies for success. Though there’s no guaranteed strategy for resolving resistance, and the hospitality industry can produce a lot of toxic and negative behaviour, I always want to learn positive and healthy forms of resolution.
