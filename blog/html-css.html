            <h2>What are the differences between Relative, Absolute, and Fixed</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Positioning is how we can take elements out of their default layout and change their behaviour to be presented differently or produce interesting effects on the page.
            </p>
            <h2>Static Positioning</h2>
            <p>
                Static positioning is the default value any element has. The element will be positioned according to the normal flow of the page. Top, right, bottom, and left values will have no effect on the elements position. 
            </p>
            <h2>Relative positioning</h2>
            <p>
                Relative positioning is very similar to static positioning, except when an element has taken its place on the page it can be modified in relation to itself to give its final position. This modification to its original position does not affect other elements, and so can overlap other elements, while the space given for the element in the page layout is the same as if position were static.
Use top, right, bottom, and left to modify its position.

            </p>
            <h2>Absolute Positioning</h2>
            <p>
                Absolute positioning again progresses from its predecessor; like relative positioning the elementâ€™s position can be modified in relation to itself using the top, right, bottom, and left values.
In contrast to relative, the original space given to the element seems to disappear while the absolute element seems to float in a layer above.

            </p>
            <h2>Fixed Positioning</h2>
            <p>
                A Fixed element is almost identical to an absolute element, the key difference being that as the name implies the element stays in its place regardless of scrolling. This kind of property is brilliant for features like navigation bars or side menus, features that are brilliant to have ready to use from any location on the page.
