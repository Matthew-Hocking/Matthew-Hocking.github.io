                <h1 class="title">What is Neuroplasticity?</h2>
                <p>
                    Also known as Brain Plasticity, Neuroplasticity is the ability to change, reorganize, and create new neurons and pathways within the brain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was widely conceived that the brain stopped creating neurons shortly after birth, and that your brain was in a “fixed state” for the rest of its life. We don’t believe this anymore. We now understand that the brain doesn’t develop into a fixed state early on in life but instead remains in a malleable plastic like state where we can create and strengthen neurons, hence the name Neuroplasticity. Because of this we can learn new things, enhance our existing cognitive capabilities, and even recover from trauma.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Neuroplasticity is an ongoing process, and because of this there are many ways we can promote growth and change within our brains.
                </p>
                <h3>Enriching our environment</h3>
                <p>
                    By creating an environment that is rich with stimulate we offer our brain many opportunities for focus, attention, and challenge. Things we can try include learning a new language, learning how to play an instrument, reading, travelling etc.
                </p>
                <h3>Plenty of rest</h3>
                <p>
                    Sleep and rest have been shown to have important effects on both physical and mental health. It’s while we sleep that our brain can develop dendritic growth. These are the growths at the end of neurons that help transmit information from one neuron to the next. 
                </p>
                <h3>Repetition</h3>
                <p>
                    Reinforcement or repetitive activities will eventually lead the adult brain to remember the new activity. Repetition is a powerful tool in strengthening the neurons and the pathways in between.

                <p>
                    “A growth mindset is when students understand that their abilities can be developed”
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Carol Dweck, 2014
                </p>
                <p>
                    The concept of a growth mindset was developed by psychologist Carol Dweck, a concept that is now being used by many schools and educators.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To put it briefly, people who understand that their skills and talents can be developed, embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and see effort as the path to mastery can reach even higher levels of achievement.
Those that have a fixed mindset avoid challenges, give up easily, and see effort as fruitless or a waste of time. As a result, they may plateau early and achieve less than their full potential. They think that their skill and talents are fixed states, and that they are incapable of attaining new abilities and increasing their intelligence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now it’s no surprise to hear about a fixed mindset, it’s an idea that many of us may have been raised hearing and taught in our lives: That brains have natural talent and fixed intellect. No good at math, can’t learn an instrument, we are often told that when we can’t achieve something that it is only because our brains are fixed and incapable of understanding or learning that skill. “it’s ok, it’s just not for you”, “some people are better at these things than others”. I’m sure we’ve all heard these things and have been made to accept: That because we are not good at it, we should stop trying or learning, we can even hear it from within ourselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But thanks to a Growth mindset we can change our perception of not only our own skills and intellect, but the way we can learn and face new challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is important for me. A lot of my life has been spent with a fixed mindset. Though I would describe myself as positive and optimistic these descriptions are not the same as a growth mindset.
I had come to accept that not only there were many things in my life I wasn’t good at, but that because I wasn’t naturally skilled at these things I was incapable of getting good at them.
This kind of mindset is extremely limiting, and people can end up thinking they’ve wasted their lives.
It’s by developing a growth mindset that we can tap into our true potential, and learn how to face and overcome new challenges; ultimately growing and building ourselves to reach higher levels of achievement and a greater sense of freedom and free will.
