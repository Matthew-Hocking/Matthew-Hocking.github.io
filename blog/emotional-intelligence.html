                <h1 class="title">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h1>
                <p>
                    “The ability to identify your own emotions and the emotions of others and use this information to guide behaviour.”.
“There is no such thing as a perfect emotionally intelligent being, rather it is a spectrum, in which everyone can learn and improve.”
- The school of life.
                </p>
                <p>
                Daniel Goleman, the Author and founding father for the concept we know today as Emotional intelligence says that EQ refers to how well we handle ourselves and our relationships through the 4 domains, though there have come to be many definitions out there;
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
Self-awareness:
knowing what we are feeling and why we are feeling it. Which is the basis for good intuition, good decision-making, and a moral compass.
                    </li>
                    <li>
Self-management:
handling our distressing emotions in an effective way so that they don’t cripple us, and yet attuning to them when we need to so that we learn what we must, every emotion has its function.
Even marshalling positive emotions; getting ourselves involved and enthused about what we’re doing, aligning our actions with our passions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
Empathy:
knowing what someone else is feeling
                    </li>
                    <li>
And the fourth is putting that altogether in Skilled relationship.
                    </li>
                </ul>
EQ is often defined as the ability to perceive, use, understand and manage emotions.
                </p>
                <p>
“Emotional intelligence can be viewed from the two major perspectives; the self, and others.
emotional intelligence in ourselves means that we can identify our emotions and respond to them.
Emotional intelligence in relation to others is the ability to be aware of other people’s emotions and use this knowledge to guide our behaviour towards them”
- Knowledge Access.

                <h1 class="title">How is it different to IQ?</h1>
                <p>
                    While emotional intelligence refers to a person’s ability to perceive, control, evaluate and express emotions, an intelligence quotient can represent abilities such as visual and spatial processing, knowledge of the world, fluid reasoning, working memory and short-term memory, and quantitative reasoning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An easier way of describing the differences of the two could be as follows.
while IQ is how you see the world and all its content, problems, reasoning and so on Emotional intelligence is how we see people and their emotions in a similar context; content of a person’s character, their emotions, solving emotional problems using self-management, using empathy to identify and understand others’ emotions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    IQ is a tool that we use to solve the problems of the physical world around us. We see something broken; we understand what is wrong with it, we know how to fix it, or we can figure out how to fix it. We use reasoning and processing to understand the world around us, granting us a better intelligence to make decisions and have better intuition.
EQ is how we see the psychological and emotional world around us. We identify that we or someone else is in distress, we identify the emotions and where they come from, and we manage those emotions for the better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe it could be simplified even more.
IQ represents knowledge, with IQ we know everything around us, and we understand how it works.
EQ represents wisdom, With EQ we know why and how people behave, why things happen, and how our behaviour can affect the outcome.
                </p>
                <h1 class="title">Why is it important?</h1>
                <p>
                    To progress from the last point made; IQ is knowledge, and EQ is wisdom, and as the old saying goes “knowledge is knowing that a tomato is a fruit, but wisdom is knowing that a tomato doesn’t belong in a fruit salad”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think this goes far to show the difference between IQ and EQ, and the function and purpose for both. Both are important but being a well-rounded human who understands the importance in developing skills in EQ will be able to learn more, do better working with others, and succeed.
